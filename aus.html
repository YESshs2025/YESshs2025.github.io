                            <h3>Uhm what's Undertale</h3>
                            <p>
                                Undertale is an indie RPG created by Toby Fox.
                                Go search it up or something,
                                or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertale">here</a>'s a list to its Wikipedia page.
                                I'm too lazy to explain it. Plus, I'm <i>trying</i> not to fail a web design class right now.
                                Maybe I'll explain it later when I have time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The reason Undertale was and still is so popular,
                                the reason the fandom is somehow still here after eight and a half years,
                                is because it really made people feel emotions,
                                and with emotions come creativity and inspiration.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Well then what's an AU</h3>
                            <p>
                                AU stands for alternate universe.
                                Like, for example, if you were on AO3 (fanfiction website)
                                and you came across a fic with the 'Soulmates AU' tag
                                that would mean that this fic takes place in an alternate universe in which, in this case,
                                soulmates are a concept that exists.
                                (wow a totally normal example that normal people will understand)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So an Undertale AU ™ is an alternate universe of Undertale.
                                It's based on Undertale, but with a twist.
                                Sometimes, it's a thematic change that doesn't change that anything much lore-wise,
                                like Outertale being literally just Undertale but it looks ✨aesthetic✨ because space.
                                Other times, the AU is a "what if?" of the original story of Undertale,
                                like in Dusttale and Something New.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In some cases, it almost seems like the creator was originally just doing a thematic change,
                                but as the worldbuilding progressed, potential for story deviations naturally formed out of their circumstances,
                                leading to unique and fitting new stories.
                                This probably happened with Underlust.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some AUs build upon other AUs.
                                AU ideas are bounced off each other, applied to each other, and combined with each other,
                                in such a way that there are layers upon layers of fan-made content.

                            <p>
                                …What if there was a story in which all of these alternate universes existed together
                                in some sort of hellish abomination reminiscent of the movie
                                <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> but every character was instead
                                an alternate version of Sans from Undertale?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fandom began becoming meta with the appearance of the character Error!Sans,
                                who canonically destroyed alternate universes,
                                and the character Ink!Sans, who sort of served as Error's counterpart, who canonically defended the AUs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The universe of Dreamtale is a particular one, being that despite its name implying it to be an AU of Undertale,
                                it is a unique story that takes place in this fan-made multiverse.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And Underverse, the sequel to Jael Peñaloza's XTale AU,
                                is a sort of crossover that features a lot of different characters from different AUs.

                                Underfell, the first Undertale AU ever created, in which all of the characters are edgy.
                                Unfortunately, its creator, Vic the Underfella,
                                has left the platform and the original material for this AU has been lost to time.

                                in which the personalities and roles of Sans and Papyrus, Undyne and Alphys,
                                Frisk and Chara, Toriel and Asgore, and a lot of other characters are swapped with each other.

                                to create an actual name for their AU instead of basing the name on Undertale,)
                                in which Killer!Sans, its version of Sans, becomes apathetic and empty inside,
                                and strikes a deal with the human, agreeing to help them commit genocide,
                                out of boredom and a desire to feel emotions once more.
                                He canonically ends up working for Nightmare!Sans from Dreamtale.
